Consumer Complaints Analysis Program -> Project_01

Introduction
This document provides an overview of the Consumer Complaints Analysis Program, designed to process and analyze consumer complaint data efficiently. The program extracts valuable insights from the data, helping executives make informed decisions to enhance customer satisfaction and address common issues.

Overview of the Program
The Consumer Complaints Analysis Program is a modular system that ingests consumer complaint data, processes it, and generates insightful analyses. The program is structured into several components, each responsible for a specific aspect of the data processing pipeline.

Key Features

Data Ingestion and Preprocessing: Efficiently reads and cleans large datasets.
Trend Analysis: Identifies patterns and trends over time.
Geographical Analysis: Maps complaints by location to identify hotspots.
Product and Issue Categorization: Highlights the most complained-about products and issues.
Data Visualization Preparation: Exports processed data for visualization in external tools.

Data Flow

1. Data Ingestion
File: src/data_ingestion.cxx

Purpose: Reads and preprocesses consumer complaint data from a JSON file.
Functions:
load_complaints(const std::string& filename): Loads complaints into a structured format.
preprocess_data(std::vector<Complaint>& complaints): Cleans and prepares data for analysis.
Includes:
utilities.h: Access to shared structures and function declarations.
json.hpp: Utilizes the nlohmann JSON library for parsing JSON data.

2. Main Program
File: main.cxx

Responsibilities:
Initializes the program and orchestrates the overall data analysis workflow.
Calls functions from various analysis modules to process and analyze data.
Function Calls:
load_complaints()
preprocess_data()
aggregate_complaints_per_month()
display_trend_analysis()
aggregate_complaints_by_state()
display_geographical_analysis()
aggregate_complaints_by_product()
aggregate_complaints_by_issue()
display_product_and_issue_analysis()
export_to_json()

3. Analysis Modules
Trend Analysis

File: src/trend_analysis.cxx
Functions:
aggregate_complaints_per_month(): Aggregates complaints over time.
display_trend_analysis(): Presents trends in complaint data.
Geographical Analysis

File: src/geographical_analysis.cxx
Functions:
aggregate_complaints_by_state(): Aggregates complaints by state.
display_geographical_analysis(): Visualizes geographical distribution of complaints.
Product and Issue Categorization

File: src/product_categorization.cxx
Functions:
aggregate_complaints_by_product(): Identifies top complained-about products.
aggregate_complaints_by_issue(): Determines most common issues.
display_product_and_issue_analysis(): Displays findings.

4. Data Visualization Preparation
File: src/data_visualization_prep.cxx

Function:
export_to_json(const std::unordered_map<std::string, int>& data, const std::string& filename): Exports processed data to JSON files for use in visualization tools.

5. Utilities and Libraries
Utilities Header

File: include/utilities.h
Purpose:
Defines the Complaint struct representing a single complaint record.
Declares common functions used across modules.
Includes json.hpp for JSON parsing capabilities.
JSON Library

File: lib/json.hpp
Purpose:
Provides JSON parsing functionality via the nlohmann JSON library.
File Relationships
Main Program Includes Utilities: main.cxx includes utilities.h to access shared data structures and function declarations.
Analysis Modules Include Utilities: Each module in the src/ directory includes utilities.h for consistent definitions.
Utilities Include JSON Library: utilities.h includes json.hpp to enable JSON parsing across the program.
Data Flow Arrows: Represent the flow of data and function calls between different parts of the program, illustrating dependencies and processing order.
Data Flow Summary
Data Loading: The program begins by loading data from consumer_complaints.json using load_complaints() in data_ingestion.cxx.

Data Preprocessing: The raw data is cleaned and preprocessed via preprocess_data(), ensuring consistency and readiness for analysis.

Data Analysis:

Trend Analysis: aggregate_complaints_per_month() and display_trend_analysis() analyze complaint trends over time.
Geographical Analysis: aggregate_complaints_by_state() and display_geographical_analysis() map complaints geographically.
Product and Issue Categorization: aggregate_complaints_by_product(), aggregate_complaints_by_issue(), and display_product_and_issue_analysis() identify key products and issues.
Data Visualization: Processed data is prepared for visualization using export_to_json() in data_visualization_prep.cxx, allowing for easy integration with external tools.

Output: Analysis results are displayed in the terminal and exported as JSON files, providing actionable insights and facilitating further exploration.
